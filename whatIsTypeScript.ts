//What is typescript?

//Programming language created by microsoft, to address the some of the shortcomings in javascript.

//Benifits:

//1. Static typing
//2. code completion
//3. Refactoring
//4. shorthand notations


//statically typed language like,

// int num = 110;
// num = "q"


//Not possible


//Dynamically typed language like,

// let num = 110;
// num = "q"

// possible

let x:number = 10;
console.log(x)
//when i change the x to "a" throws an error
