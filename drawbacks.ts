//Drawbacks


//1. Compilation, until Compilation the browser doesnt understand ts code,

// .ts   complies and convert the code into .js. This process is called Transpilation

// Browsers do not understand TypeScript directly. They understand JavaScript.
//  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features, 
//  but it needs to be transpiled into plain JavaScript before it can be executed by a browser.


//2. Discipline in coding
